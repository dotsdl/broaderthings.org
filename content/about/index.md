Hey! I'm David L. Dotson, a physicist and software/systems engineer.
Welcome to **the broader things**, my public development log.

{{< image src="dotsdl-avatar.jpg" width=400 position=center title="David L. Dotson" style="border-width: 2px;" >}}

Most of my work comprises open source software engineering, and this means I can share much of what I work on freely and publicly.
This space functions as a kind of scratch pad for this work, especially on topics of systems and software design. 

I also own and operate a consultancy, [datryllic](https://datryllic.com/).

This is my primary vehicle for helping others to use the things I work on, especially industrial users.

If you are looking for guidance and assistance in solving your business problems with the projects I contribute to, feel free to [get in touch](https://datryllic.com/contact/)!
