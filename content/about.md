Hey! I'm David Dotson, a physicist and software/systems engineer.
Welcome to **the broader things**, my public development log.

Most of my work comprises open source software engineering, and this means I can share much of what I work on freely and publicly.
This space functions as a kind of scratch pad for this work, especially on topics of systems and software design. 

I also own and operate a consultancy, [datryllc](https://datryllic.com/).
This is my primary vehicle for helping others to use the things I work on, especially industrial users.

If you are looking for guidance and assistance in solving your business problems with the projects I contribute to, feel free to [get in touch](https://datryllic.com/contact/)!
